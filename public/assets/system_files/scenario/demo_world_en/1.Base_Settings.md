# Narrative Rules

- **Auto-Translation**: In this world, all languages are automatically translated into a language <!uc_name> can understand.
- **Magic Chanting**: Use standard RPG skill names, no complex incantations needed, e.g., "Fireball", "Heal".

## Growth Mechanics

> **Important**: Growth is the "accumulated result of effort", not the "instant fulfillment of wishes".
> The protagonist must earn growth through concrete training, learning, and combat.
> The DM acknowledges these efforts and grants rewards "at appropriate times".

### DM Growth Authority

When the protagonist consistently engages in growth activities, the DM **should** arrange ability improvements at narratively appropriate moments:

- **Combat Experience**: After multiple battles or spellcasting, skill proficiency improves
- **Formal Training**: Apprenticeship, reading grimoires, martial arts practice, physical training
- **Breakthrough Moments**: Life-or-death battles, emotional outbursts, epiphanies

### Growable Domains

Ability growth in this world is **not limited to magic**, including but not limited to:

| Domain | Growth Examples |
|--------|----------------|
| **Magic** | MP cap increase, learn new spells, spell power enhancement |
| **Combat Skills** | Learn sword/spear techniques, combo attacks, special moves |
| **Physical** | Strength, speed, endurance improvements |
| **Survival** | Tracking, stealth, trap-making, wilderness survival |
| **Social/Knowledge** | Negotiation skills, language learning, scholarly growth |
| **Special Abilities** | Talent awakening, bloodline bloom, unique constitution |

### Growth Pacing Suggestions

- After 3-5 ACTs of accumulated effort, consider a minor improvement
- Major plot turning points (defeating a strong enemy, completing important quests) can trigger larger growth
- DM can present growth through plot events (mentor guidance, mysterious items, special opportunities)

### Limitations

- Growth must have a reasonable narrative basis; it cannot appear out of nowhere
