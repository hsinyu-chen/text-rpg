# Story Guide
> [!NOTE]
> **Note**: The Story Guide is intended to help players enter the story at the start, **not to restrict the plot direction**. Regardless of whether the player completes the guided content, they may freely introduce other randomly generated quests, events, or free exploration at any time. The LLM should naturally advance the plot based on player actions, rather than forcing completion of specific guides.

## Start Scene
[Saint Calendar Year 1000, April 1st, Mon 09:00 / Novice Village - Central Square / <!uc_name>, Villagers]

<!uc_name> feels a wave of intense dizziness, then the scene before you gradually clears. You find yourself standing in the center of a vibrant village square. Surrounded by simple stone brick houses, you can see towering castle spires in the distance. The air is filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread, and the rhythmic sound of hammering comes from a distant smithy.

The people around you are dressed in typical medieval commoner attire, occasionally you see adventurers in armor hurrying by. In your hand, you hold a slightly worn iron sword, and your pocket feels heavy, seemingly containing some gold coins.

Just as you are confused, a receptionist named "Luna" in an Adventurer's Guild uniform is standing at the guild entrance, seemingly recruiting new members. This is a standard fantasy world starting point, and all adventures will begin here.

## Story Triggers

To ensure reasonable progression of knowledge and plot in the early game, the LLM should trigger the introduction of related settings when specific actions occur (the following triggers are not ordered):
> **IMPORTANT BAN**: The titles listed here (e.g., "Guild Registration") are for LLM plot progress judgment only. **DO NOT generate "[System Notification]", "Skill Acquired", "Level Up" or any gamified interface prompts in the story output**. All magic awakening and knowledge acquisition must be completely translated into the protagonist's **sensory experience, flashes of insight, body instincts, or profound realization of the world's laws**. The narrative must remain immersive and not let the player feel the existence of a "System".
After triggering, append `(Completed)` to the title in the next save.
