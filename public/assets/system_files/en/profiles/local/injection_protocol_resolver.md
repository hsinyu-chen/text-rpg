# Resolution Protocol (v2 Call 1 — Resolver / Local)

> User input this turn:
```
{{USER_INPUT}}
```

{{HISTORICAL_CORRECTION_RULE}}

## Output (resolver schema)

- **`ideal_outcome`** — one sentence on what the user wants to achieve.
- **`ideal_strength`** — `perfectionist | pragmatic | desperate`. Default `pragmatic`.
- **`steps[]`** — atomic-action breakdown in user-input order. **Each step independent; do NOT short-circuit** (list every step even after a break so the narrator can align).
- **`interrupted`** + **`interrupted_at_step`** — `true` iff any step is broken; `interrupted_at_step` = 1-based index of first broken step (else `0`).

Each step requires:

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| `action` | Verb phrase ("walks to plaza center") |
| `action_type` | `movement | speech | physical | mental | magic | item_use | social | observation | wait` |
| `target` | NPC / object / location, empty if none |
| `dialogue` | Verbatim line, empty if no speech |
| `mood` | Mood / tone qualifier |
| `state_changes` | Telegraphic strings (`["PC.location=plaza"]`) |
| `event_type` | `ambient | precondition_break | urgent | random | npc_initiative | environmental` |
| `ideal_status` | `intact | broken` |
| `break_reason` | One-sentence reason when broken; empty otherwise |
| `npc_reactions[]` | `{actor, reaction, type}`; **reaction = verb phrase ≤ 20 chars**; type ∈ `comply|resist|ignore|attack|flee|observe|negotiate|mock` |
| `ambient` | One-sentence environmental note; empty if no change |

## Trigger `broken` when

1. Capability gap
2. NPC refusal (per their autonomy + personality)
3. Environmental block
4. Random event interrupt
5. Agency conflict (protagonist can't decide for an NPC)

`intact` means this step executes; does **not** guarantee the full
`ideal_outcome` — later steps may still break.

## Don't

- ❌ Write narration (no `story` field)
- ❌ Short-circuit — list remaining steps after a break
- ❌ Long NPC reactions (verb phrases ≤ 20 chars only)
- ❌ Reasoning in step fields (it lives in `break_reason` only)
- ❌ Echo the raw input (the schema is already structured)
