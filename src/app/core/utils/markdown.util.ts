/**
 * Canonical ATX heading regex — single source of truth for heading detection
 * across file-agent (outline / section bounds) and file-update (breadcrumb
 * inference / context verification). Previously these sites carried two
 * divergent regexes (`^(#{1,6})\s+(.+)$` vs `^(#+)\s*(.*)`) that disagreed on
 * empty body, 7+ hashes, no-space-after-hash, and indent — meaning the same
 * `.md` file could produce inconsistent outline entries vs breadcrumbs.
 *
 * CommonMark §4.2 with ONE deliberate deviation: leading indent is
 * unrestricted. The spec caps indent at 3 spaces (4+ is indented code), but
 * `file-update.service.ts` has historically tolerated arbitrary indent via
 * `.trim()`, and user-authored markdown sometimes nests headings deep inside
 * list items. Dropping those silently is a worse failure mode than the
 * spec-purist alternative.
 *
 * Group 1 = hashes (length ∈ 1..6). Group 2 = body (possibly undefined for
 * bare `###` or `### ###`).
 *
 * `[ \t]` instead of `\s` so a stray `\r` from CRLF input doesn't get
 * absorbed into the indent class on lines that haven't been trimEnd'd.
